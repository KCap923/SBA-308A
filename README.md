- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Krystle, my idea for this project was to create a art gallery! This was my first time working with an API and I wanted to create something fun and light. While I was looking through the available API's the Art Institute of Chicago immediatly caught my attention.
I love art and combing two of my interests made this project so fun! The heading GalerÃ­a Ã‰clat, Galeria is gallery in spanish & Ã‰clat (a kla) is French for brilliance. So without further ado welcome to The GalerÃ­a Ã‰clat, the gallery of the brilliant!
